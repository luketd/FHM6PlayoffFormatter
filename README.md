# FHM6PlayoffFormatter
The java program is used to take the playoff schedule from mysql into java to create jsons from set playoff brackets


The 2 Jars needed to run this probject is
mysql-connector-java-8.0.21.jar
json-simple-1.1.1.jar 


Connect whatever database you want, that has the 2 teams and 2 scores, and then the only other customization youll have to do is for different playoff formats.

The one's I have is the 8 team and the 12 team playoffs.
